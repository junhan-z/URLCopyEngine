# URLCopyEngine
A chrome extension to copy a specific pattern of current URL
I was annoyed by sending certain parts of a url.
For example, I encountered such use cases:

The URL  
`domain/cl/<number>/other_stuff`

While the browser supports such format as `cl/<number>` and it is exchanged via communication channel all the time. 
Having a one click button is way more convenient than select text.

Some website might have a copy button, but having this one you can customize for whatever site(google.com only for now).
